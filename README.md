This project focuses on predicting customer churn â€” the likelihood that a customer will stop using a company's product or service. Using real-world data, we built and evaluated multiple machine learning models to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on behavioral, transactional, and demographic features. The goal is to help businesses proactively identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.), evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC-ROC), and deployment-ready code.
